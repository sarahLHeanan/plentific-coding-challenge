# Plentific Coding Challenge
This repo contains a docker environment based on PHP 8.2 and a very basic UI demonstrating use of the package https://github.com/sarahLHeanan/plentific-coding-challenge-library.

I did consider pulling in a frontend framework such as Tailwind but decided against it as it seems out of scope

The previous repo also contains unit tests to demo functionality.
